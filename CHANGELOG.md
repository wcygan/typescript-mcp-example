## [1.0.0-dev] - 2024-12-18

### Added
- Initial project foundation
- MCP server implementation with Kubernetes integration
- Three operational MCP tools for cluster management
- Complete Deno configuration and task management
- Documentation suite covering installation, API, configuration, and testing
- Incremental testing infrastructure and strategy

### Features
- **AI-Powered Cluster Management**: Enables AI assistants to manage Kubernetes resources through standardized MCP tools
- **Safety-First Development**: Incremental testing ensures each component works before building the next layer
- **Modern Runtime**: Built on Deno for native TypeScript support and secure defaults
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Tool-specific testing, integration tests, and cluster connectivity verification

### Architecture
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized interface for AI assistant integration
- **Kubernetes API**: Direct integration with cluster management APIs
- **Deno Runtime**: Modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with built-in tooling
- **Incremental Design**: Each component testable independently

### Development Workflow
```bash
deno task init         # Initialize project and verify setup
deno task verify-k8s   # Test Kubernetes connectivity
deno task test-mcp     # Test MCP server basics
deno task test         # Run all tests
deno task dev          # Start development server
```
